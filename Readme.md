## Description
FreeCycle is a mobile application implemented using React Native. The app is designed to help people give away items they no longer need to others who can use them. Users can post listings of items they want to give away for free, and other users can browse and claim these items. The app aims to make it easy and convenient for people to declutter their homes and reduce waste, while also providing a platform for those who may not be able to afford certain items to obtain them for free. FreeCycle app can be used on both iOS and Andriod.
